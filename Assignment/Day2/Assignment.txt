Document Object - 
	- The Document Object represents a webpage structure that is inserted in the DOM tree hierarchy and when compiled the content gets displayed on the webpage. By getting access to the document object, the users can access the HTML webpage content along with the elements by which the webpage is built. 

	- When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
	- The document object is the root node of the HTML document and the "owner" of all other nodes :( element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, and comment nodes).
	- The document object provides properties and methods to access all node objects, from within JavaScript.
	- The document is a part of the Window object and can be accessed as window.document.
